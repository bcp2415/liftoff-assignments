## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We will createa an app to help people stay more focused and accomplish their goals.  Many people, including those with ADHD, struggle to accomplish tasks on a daily basis.  Our app will help with this not only by providing a place to list tasks and check them off when they are finished, but also by integrating a reward system and in-app virtual pets who will encourage task completion.

The reward system will let users accrue in-app currency, which they can then spend to treat themselves to rewards of their choice.  The actual rewards and costs will be set by users themselves.  The virtual pets will act as encouragers and gentle reminders to complete tasks; if no tasks have been completed in a while, the pet will began to look hungry or sad, and can be "fed" or cheered up by completing a task.
